📘 Module 01 – Router Basics & Initial Configuration
This module contains four foundational labs focused on essential router configuration, device security, and interface setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. These labs were based on the Jeremy’s IT Lab Free CCNA Labs and tailored to reinforce hands-on skills for CompTIA Network+ preparation.

🧪 Labs Included
🔐 Lab 1 – Enable Password and Encryption
Objective: Set and observe how enable password is stored, and apply service password-encryption.

Result: Demonstrated that enable password is stored in plain text unless encrypted, and confirmed that removing encryption does not decrypt existing passwords.

🔒 Lab 2 – Enable Secret vs Enable Password
Objective: Compare enable password with enable secret, understand which one takes precedence, and analyze encryption types.

Result: Verified that enable secret overrides enable password, and is securely hashed (type 5), unlike type 7 obfuscation.

🖥️ Lab 3 – Console Access Security
Objective: Configure console access with a password and enforce login requirements.

Result: Successfully secured local console access, observed password encryption behavior, and saved the configuration from a local terminal session.

🔌 Lab 4 – CDP Discovery & Serial Link Setup
Objective: Use CDP to discover neighboring devices, configure serial links with IPs and clock rate, and test router connectivity.

Result: Correctly identified DCE/DTE ends, set clock rate on DCE side, assigned IPs, and successfully pinged between routers.
