# Module 2 – VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing

This module covers essential concepts and configurations for VLANs, trunking, inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick), troubleshooting common issues, and basic switch security. It follows the structure of **Jeremy’s IT Lab Free CCNA Labs** and is designed to build hands-on expertise in VLAN segmentation and routing.

## **Labs Overview**

### **005 - VLAN Configuration**
- Configures VLANs and assigns switch ports to specific VLANs.
- Verifies device connectivity within the same VLAN.

### **006 - VLAN Configuration Trunk Encapsulation**
- Configures a trunk link between switches.
- Explains how 802.1Q encapsulation preserves VLAN tagging.

### **007 - Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS)**
- Implements router-on-a-stick using sub-interfaces on a single router interface.
- Configures IP addresses and tests communication across VLANs.

### **008 - Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS) Troubleshooting #1**
- Identifies and resolves misconfigurations in sub-interface VLAN IDs and trunking.

### **009 - Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS) Troubleshooting #2**
- Fixes default gateway and trunk mode issues to restore inter-VLAN communication.

### **010 - Local Username-Password Database**
- Configures local user accounts on a router.
- Demonstrates case sensitivity of passwords vs usernames.

### **011 - Message of the Day and Login Banner**
- Adds legal and informational login banners.
- Verifies proper display of MOTD and login banners.

### **012 - Naming VLANs**
- Assigns descriptive names to VLANs.
- Verifies communication within VLANs and improves network documentation.
