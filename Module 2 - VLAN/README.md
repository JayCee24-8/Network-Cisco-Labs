#📘 Module 02 – VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing

This module introduces VLAN creation, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick) while also focusing on basic switch security and troubleshooting. The labs are based on Jeremy’s IT Lab Free CCNA Labs and are designed to reinforce VLAN segmentation, trunk encapsulation, and communication between multiple VLANs.

🧪 Labs Included

🌐 Lab 5 – VLAN Configuration  
**Objective:** Create VLANs, assign ports, and verify connectivity within the same VLAN.  
**Result:** Confirmed that devices in the same VLAN can communicate, while those in different VLANs cannot without routing.

🔗 Lab 6 – VLAN Configuration Trunk Encapsulation  
**Objective:** Configure trunk links between switches using 802.1Q encapsulation.  
**Result:** Verified that VLAN tags are preserved across trunk links, enabling VLAN traffic to pass between switches.

🔀 Lab 7 – Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS)  
**Objective:** Implement Router-on-a-Stick with sub-interfaces for inter-VLAN communication.  
**Result:** Successfully configured sub-interfaces and IP addressing, allowing traffic between VLANs.

🛠️ Lab 8 – Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS) Troubleshooting #1  
**Objective:** Identify and fix misconfigurations related to VLAN IDs and trunking.  
**Result:** Corrected sub-interface VLAN ID issues and restored inter-VLAN connectivity.

🛠️ Lab 9 – Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS) Troubleshooting #2  
**Objective:** Troubleshoot trunk mode and default gateway errors.  
**Result:** Fixed trunk configuration on SW2 and corrected default gateway for VLAN 13.

👤 Lab 10 – Local Username-Password Database  
**Objective:** Configure local user accounts for device login authentication.  
**Result:** Demonstrated that passwords are case-sensitive while usernames are not.

📢 Lab 11 – Message of the Day and Login Banner  
**Objective:** Set up login banners for user notifications and security warnings.  
**Result:** Confirmed that MOTD and login banners display correctly before login prompts.

🏷️ Lab 12 – Naming VLANs  
**Objective:** Assign descriptive names to VLANs for better documentation.  
**Result:** Successfully named VLANs and verified connectivity within each VLAN.
