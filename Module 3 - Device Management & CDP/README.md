# 📘 Module 03 – Device Management & CDP

This module focuses on Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) for device discovery, the system configuration dialog for quick setup, and the creation of loopback interfaces for testing and management. These labs enhance your ability to identify, configure, and manage Cisco devices effectively.

## 🧪 Labs Included

### 🔍 Lab 13 – CDP Part 1  
**Objective:** Enable and use CDP to identify connected devices, determine DCE/DTE roles, and configure clock rates.  
**Result:** Verified CDP neighbor details, confirmed default CDP timers, and successfully set the clock rate on the DCE side.

### 🔍 Lab 14 – CDP Part 2  
**Objective:** Use CDP to retrieve detailed information about neighboring devices, including platform and IOS version.  
**Result:** Successfully obtained device hardware and software details using `show cdp neighbors detail`.

### ⚙️ Lab 15 – System Configuration Dialog  
**Objective:** Configure routers and switches using the system setup dialog and save the configuration to NVRAM.  
**Result:** Completed initial configuration (hostnames, passwords, IPs) and verified connectivity via ping.

### 🔁 Lab 16 – Loopback Interface Configuration  
**Objective:** Create, test, and remove loopback interfaces on routers.  
**Result:** Configured loopback interfaces, verified local and remote pings, and removed the interfaces as required.

## 🔧 Skills Practiced Across Labs
- Enabling and disabling CDP globally and per interface.
- Identifying neighboring device information with CDP commands.
- Initial device setup using the system configuration dialog.
- Configuring and managing loopback interfaces for testing.
- Understanding DCE/DTE roles and setting clock rates on serial links.
